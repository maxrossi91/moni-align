A Read Aligner with Multi-Genome References.

MONI index uses the prefix-free parsing of the text [2][3] to build the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) of the reference genomes, the suffix array (SA) samples at the beginning and at the end of each run of the BWT, and the threshold positions of [1]. The MONI index can be built from (a) one or more FASTA file(s) or (b) a reference FASTA and one or more VCF files.  

Maximal Exact Matches (MEMs) are extracted between the reads and the multi-genome reference using the MONI index. The reads are aligned to the multi-genome reference by using the MEMs as seeds to guide read alignment, a similar strategy employed by other popular read aligners [4]. The alignments are reported in reference coordinates by lifting over the multi-genome alignments to the reference genome [5]. A SAM file is produced that can be used in downstream analysis software such as variant callers. 

# Install

There are two ways to be able to run `moni-align`. The easiest way is to run the tool from the `Docker` or `Singularity/Apptainer` image. The other way is to build it from source (Linux only).  

## Docker

1. Pull the image from DockerHub
```
docker pull rvarki/moni-align:latest
```
2. Run the `moni` help command. 
```
docker run rvarki/moni-align moni -h
```

> [!NOTE] 
> Make sure to include the -v option in the docker run command before attempting to run any `moni` commands on your data. The -v option will allow you to [mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) your host directory into the Docker container so that `moni` can interact with your data. Users are encouraged to mount into `\mnt` directory in the Docker containter. 

## Singularity/Apptainer

If working on a high performance computing cluster, you might not have access to `Docker` due to it needing root permissions. Instead, you can use the `Singularity/Apptainer` version of the tool.

1. Build the SIF image of `moni-align`
```
singularity pull moni.sif docker://rvarki/moni-align:latest
```
or
```
apptainer build moni.sif docker://rvarki/moni-align:latest
```
2. Run the `moni` help command

```
./moni.sif moni -h
```

## Building from source
Currently, building from source only works on Linux machines. 

`moni-align` has the following dependencies:

- `gcc` tool (version 9.3.0/9.4.0 or greater)
- `cmake`tool (version 3.15 or greater) 

After installing the dependencies, the following steps can be run to build the project.

1. Run the build steps 

```
git clone https://github.com/maxrossi91/moni-align.git
cd moni-align
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

> [!WARNING]
> Do not run make -j. There are some implicit dependencies between the subprojects that moni-align builds and running make in parallel will cause the build to fail.

2. Run the `moni` help command
```
./moni -h
```

> [!NOTE]
> The project contains legacy commands. See the Legacy Commands section for more details.

# Example

We provide test data located in the `data/mouse` directory to test the commands. We use this test data to showcase how to perform some common operations.

## Building the Moni index

Prior to running the alignment step, the `moni` index of the references must first be created. The references can stored either in concatenated FASTA format or reference FASTA and VCF file. The only major difference between building with either option is that the alignment liftover step is currently only possible when the index is built with a reference FASTA and VCF file. If the index with a concatenated FASTA, the downstream alignments will be reported to the haplotype it aligned to instead. Here we show building the index with both types of input.

1. Building the index with reference FASTA file + VCF file.
```
./moni build -r ../data/mouse/ref/mouse.chr19.fa.gz -v ../data/mouse/vcf/mouse.chr19.subset.vcf.gz -S ../data/mouse/vcf/mouse_samples.txt -H12 -o ../data/mouse/index/mouse 
```

Here we provide a brief summary of the options used in the above command.

- -r : The location of the reference FASTA file. The reference FASTA is expected to have the .gz extension.

- -v : The location of the corresponding VCF file. The file should be structured such that the reference alleles at all positions match the reference FASTA file.

- -S : A file containing the names of the samples in the VCF to build the index from. This is optional to provide, however `moni` assumes to use all samples in the VCF if not provided.

- -H : The haplotype information from the VCF file to include. Write -H1 to include only the information from haplotype 1, -H2 to include only the information from haplotype 2, or -H12 to include information from both haplotypes.

- -o : The location of the output directory and the prefix of the output files. For the example, the files will be written to this location: `../data/mouse/index/` with the files having the `mouse` prefix. 


2. Building the index with only a FASTA file.

```
./moni build -f ../data/mouse/ref/mouse.chr19.fa.gz -o ../data/mouse/index/mouse
```

Here we provide a brief summary of the options used in the above command.

- -f : The location of the reference FASTA file. The reference FASTA is expected to have the .gz extension.

- -o : The location of the output directory and the prefix of the output files. For example, in this example, the files will be written to this location: `../data/mouse/index/` with the files having the `mouse` prefix.

Regardless of which method used to build the index, the following files should be produced in the `data/mouse/index` directory: `mouse.ldx`, `mouse.lidx`, `mouse.moni.log`, `mouse.plain.slp`, `mouse.slcp`, and `mouse.thrbv.full.lcp.ms`

> [!NOTE]
> To see the other build options available, type ./moni build -h 

## Aligning the reads

After building the `moni` index, reads can be aligned to the pangenome. The align function accepts both single and paired-end reads in either FASTA or FASTQ format. Here we show how to run the alignment step with both paired-end and single-end reads.

By default, there are three types of filters applied: A MEM occurance filter (-S), a MEM orientation (-D) filter, and a MEM frequency filter (-F). These filters were designed to speed up the alignment step and lower the peak memory usage. See [Selecting appropriate filter settings](#Selecting-appropriate-filter-settings) for a more detailed explaination about the filters.

1. Aligning with paired-end reads.
```
./moni align -i ../data/mouse/index/mouse -1 ../data/mouse/reads/mouse.chr19.R1.fastq -2 ../data/mouse/reads/mouse.chr19.R2.fastq -o ../data/mouse/output/mouse.sam
```

Here we provide a brief summary of the options used in the above command.

- -i : The path to where the previously created index files are located and the prefix of these files. For the example, the index files are located in this location: `../data/mouse/index/` with the `mouse` prefix.

- -1 : The location of the mate 1 file.
- -2 : The location of the mate 2 file.

- -o : The location of where to write the output SAM file and the name of the SAM file. For the example, the SAM file will be written to  this location: `../data/mouse/index/` with the name: `mouse.sam`.

2. Aligning with single-end reads.

```
./moni align -i ../data/mouse/index/mouse -p ../data/mouse/reads/mouse.chr19.R1.fastq -o ../data/mouse/output/mouse.sam
```
Here we provide a brief summary of the options used in the above command.

- -i : The path to where the previously created index files are located and the prefix of these files. For the example, the index files are located in this location: `../data/mouse/index/` with the `mouse` prefix.

- -p : The location of the single-end read file.

- -o : The location of where to write the output SAM file and the name of the SAM file. For the example, the SAM file will be written to  this location: `../data/mouse/index/` with the name: `mouse.sam`.


Either command should produce the `mouse.sam` file in the `data/mouse/output` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> To see the other alignment options available, type ./moni align -h

## Selecting appropriate filter settings

There are three type of MEM filters implemented in `moni align`. 

1. MEM occurance filter (-S 1000): This filter by default keeps 1000 occurances of a MEM per genome in the pangenome. This threshold can be modified with the -S option, or can be disabled with the -s option. 

> [!NOTE]
> The MEM occurance filter is the only filter applied during the seed extraction step. The remaining two filter are applied after the seed extractions step. This filter plays an important role in limiting the memory usage. 

2. MEM frequency filter (-F 0.5): This filter by default removes MEMs whose occurances account for over 50% of the total MEM occurances for the read. This threshold can be modified with the -F option, or can be disabled with the -f option.

3. MEM orientation feature (-D 50): This filter by default removes MEM occurances found on either the forward or reverse strand if the average size of the MEMs found on both two strands differs by more than 50 bp. The MEMs are removed from the strand that produced the smaller MEMs on average. This filter is only applied when aligning paired-end reads. This threshold can be changed with the -D option, or can be disabled with the -d option.


Filtering MEMs is generally recommended when using the `moni align` function. However, there is not a universal setting for filtering. The settings to choose are highly contingent on the similarity between the read set and pangenome. Too much filtering can cause many reads to go unaligned whereas not enough filtering can cause the computational time and memory usage of the alignment step to significantly increase. To help aid users in choosing appropriate settings, the align function has a -c or --csv option that writes a CSV file containing relevant MEM statistics for each read. This can be used to help determine what filter values would be appropriate for the read set.
The CSV file contains the following information:

- 1st column: Read Name
- 2nd column: Number of unique MEMs between the read and the pangenome 
- 3rd column: Total number of MEMs between the read and the pangenome 
- 4th column: The maximum frequency of any one MEM in the pangenome
- 5th column: The minimum frequency of any one MEM in the pangenome 
- 6th column: The largest number of occurances of a MEM on any genome in the pangenome 
- 7th column: The smallest number of occurances of a MEM on any genome in the pangenome
- 8th column: Number of MEMs filtered due to the filters applied
- 9th column: Number of chains skipped due to left MEM chain heuristic check

> [!NOTE]
> Columns 2-7 are calculated prior to filtering.

If aligning a large number of reads, a good strategy would be to first subsample a small portion of the reads and then run `moni align` with the -c option in order to help determine what filters should be applied for the full read set. 

## Writing MEMs to SAM

If only the MEM occurances in the pangenome are desired, we provide an option to write the MEMs of the read to the SAM file instead of the full read alignments. This can be done with both single and paired-end reads in either FASTA or FASTQ format. Here we show how to do it with paired-end reads, but the command can easily be modified for single-end reads.  

1. Writing the MEMs of length 25 or greater to the SAM file for all reads. 
```
./moni align -i ../data/mouse/index/mouse -1 ../data/mouse/reads/mouse.chr19.R1.fastq -2 ../data/mouse/reads/mouse.chr19.R2.fastq -o ../data/mouse/output/mouse.sam --report_mems -d -s -f -l 25
```

Here we provide a brief summary of the options used in the above command.

- -i : The path to where the previously created index files are located and the prefix of these files. For the example, the index files are located in this location: `../data/mouse/index/` with the `mouse` prefix.

- -1 : The location of the mate 1 file.
- -2 : The location of the mate 2 file.

- -o : The location of where to write the output SAM file and the name of the SAM file. For the example, the SAM file will be written to  this location: `../data/mouse/index/` with the name: `mouse.sam`.

- --report_mems: This option will cause `moni` write the MEMs of mate1 and mate2 found in the forward and reverse direction to the SAM file rather than the read alignments. 

- -s : Disable the MEM occurance filter.

- -d : Disable the MEM orientation filter.

- -f : Disable the MEM frequency filter

- -l : Set the MEM length cutoff filter. 

Running this command will write all MEMs of length 25 or greater to the SAM file for all reads. This will likely cause the SAM file created to be much larger in size than if reporting the read alignments. This is because each read can have multiple entries in the SAM file depending on how many MEMs are found in the pangenome. The same MEM from the same read can have multiple entires if it is found in multiple of the genomes. 

# Legacy Commands

This project includes some legacy commands that were inherited from previous projects. These commands remain in the codebase because they are deeply embedded, and removing them would be complex. We do not guarantee that these commands will work as expected, and we will not address issues related to them in this repository.
